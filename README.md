### Welcome!

**I'm [Skyler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skylerburger/) (he/him) and I like to tinker with:**

**Here you'll find a mix of projects and experiments:**

- Listen to Spotify while studying or working? **[Ambix](https://ambix.herokuapp.com/)** allows you to mix ambient soundscapes on top of your Spotify playback to create the perfect atmosphere. The code is over in the **[Ambix-Org](https://www.github.com/ambix-org/)**.

- Do you develop in Python? Check out my **[PVP Workflow Guide](https://dev.to/skybur/pvp-a-workflow-for-python-projects-29h3)** and accompanying assistant script, **[Poet](https://github.com/SkylerBurger/poet)**.

- Have a growing collection of films? Take account of your hoard with **[MyColl](https://mycoll.app/)**, a cataloging application that helps you keep track of physical and digital copies of your favorite films. Check out the code over in the **[MyColl-Org](https://www.github.com/mycoll-org/)**

- Feeling mischievous and want to generate a funny ransom note image? Try **[SpooPyNotes](https://spoopy-notes.firebaseapp.com/)**! *(It may take a moment to return the first image; it's deployed on a free service :D)*

- Enjoy web scrapers and APIs? Here's a collection of a few I've played with in my **[apis_and_scrapers](https://github.com/SkylerBurger/apis_and_scrapers)** repo. 

- Need a quick dip into the 78 mirrors of the Tarot? Dare to peer behind the **[Veil](https://veil-app.herokuapp.com/)**! This is a really early project but still fun to play with.

### Thank You For Stopping By!
