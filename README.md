### Welcome Gentle Beings!

**I'm [Skyler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skylerburger/) (he/him) and I like to tinker with:**

**Here you'll find a mix of small projects and experiments:**

- Feeling mischievous and want to generate a ransom note? Try **[SpooPyNotes](https://spoopy-notes.firebaseapp.com/)**! *(Back end deployed on Heroku, so it may take few seconds to get an image the first time :D)*

- Enjoy web scrapers and APIs? There's a collection of a few I've played with in my **[apis_and_scrapers](https://github.com/SkylerBurger/apis_and_scrapers)** repo. 

- Do you develop in Python? Check out my **[PVP Workflow Guide](https://dev.to/skybur/pvp-a-workflow-for-python-projects-29h3)** and accompanying assistant script, **[Poet](https://github.com/SkylerBurger/poet)**.

- Need a quick dip into the 78 mirrors of the Tarot? Dare to peer behind the **[Veil](https://veil-app.herokuapp.com/)**! This is an early project of mine that I desperately need to update but still plenty fun to play with! Even in digital form I still experience uncanny moments with these cards.

### Thank You For Stopping By!
